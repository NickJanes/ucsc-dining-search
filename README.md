A simple python web scraper that would parse available cafeteria schedules for the 7+ different cafeterias around the UCSC campus, 
## Why?
The UCSC campus has several dining halls accross the campus serving a limited variety of meals on varying rotations. As a picky eater, I quickly wanted to find a way to locate which dining halls were serving foods I would eat. An example, searching for Orange Chicken would reveal which dining halls on which upcoming dates would it be served.

## Usage
Simply download the zip to a repository and change the search line to your requested item. 
Any menu item containing said item will be posted with a date in the console. 

To execute the program perform this command:
```python
python webscraper.py
